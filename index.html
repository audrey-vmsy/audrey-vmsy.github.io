                        In 2023, TIME reported, "...as of Monday, Jan. 9, red and white onions in the Philippines were sold for as high as <b>600 pesos ($10.88)</b> per kilogram, 
                        or about $5 per pound, based on the agriculture department’s monitoring of Manila-area market prices.

                        That’s about <b>three times as expensive as chicken and 25%-50% more expensive than pork or beef</b>, according to the same market monitoring estimates. 
                    <br><br>
                        <i><b><u>The cost of a kilogram of onions is greater than the minimum wage for a day’s work in the Philippines</u></b></i>."

                    <br>
                        This event sparked intrigue worldwide, having people ask, “What caused this?”. 
                    <br><br>
                        The answer being the country reaching record 14-year-high levels of inflation, as well as a shortage of onions. 
                        In the months following the incident, measures such as onion importing had to be taken to alleviate the issue.
