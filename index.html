                        Our project is an analysis of the food price trends in the Philippines over the past years, and in relation to the common Filipino household's
                        average income. AS&R seeks to utilize the data science concepts we have learned in this course to investigate the issue, and acquire new
                        knowledge that may help our country.

                        Food is essential in ensuring a person's survival, but beyond that, it is also an essence of Filipino culture. From our many local
                        specialties to family recipes, the precious time spend with loved ones during mealtimes, and our display of Filipino hospitality
                        to guests with a simple <i>merienda</i> snack. Food has the ability to bond a household, but it is a reality that the state of Philippines'
                        food pricing is potentially headed upward, and not all families may have the luxury of being able to adapt to these price changes.

                        As such, the group has chosen to focus on the rise and variation of food prices in the Philippines, 
                        hoping to utilize data science to observe trends that might provide new information on the issue.
