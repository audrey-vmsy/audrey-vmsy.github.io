                                        Firstly is the World Food Programme's extensive database of food prices, with data from the years 2000 to 2024. 
                                        It classifies each entry by date, location, category of food item, specific food item, and prices in Philippine
                                        Peso and U.S. Dollar. Wholesale and Farm prices were also found in the dataset, but these were <u>excluded</u> as the study
                                        is focusing on the household consumers' perspective on the prices.

                                        release was the latest survey published at present, as the 2023 survey is still currently being conducted.
